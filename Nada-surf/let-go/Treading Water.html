<div><span>Movies like zoos</span><br>
<span>Try another me and I will try another you</span><br>
<span>Or put my arms around you, like I think you want me to</span><br>
<span>But tell me what you're thinking</span><br>
<span>I so often misconstrue</span><br>

<div><span>Treading water</span><br>
<span>Treading white wine</span><br>
<span>Seeing borders</span><br>
<span>Seeing straight lines</span><br>
<span>I get these feelings that I don't have much time</span><br>
<span>Always rushing, always late</span><br>
<span>Always rushing, always late</span><br>
<span>Always late</span><br>

<div><span>Movies like zoos</span><br>
<span>I talk to missionaries when they're standing at my door</span><br>
<span>They tell me what I should be reading</span><br>
<span>I still can't see what for</span><br>
<span>We both stand there politely, trying to change each other's core</span><br>

<div><span>When other angels float by</span><br>
<span>They seem likely to fall from the sky</span><br>
<span>What I want is difficult</span><br>
<span>I must try</span><br>
<span>I see traces when you walk</span><br>
<span>And other voices when you talk</span><br>
<span>When you talk</span><br>
<span>When other angels float by</span><br>

<span>I see traces when you walk</span><br>
