                <span class="drums">DRUMS</span>

<div><span>So quiet</span><br>
<span>It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high</span><br>
<span>And the ring around the moon</span><br>
<span>Looks like light and love</span><br>
<span>Neither of which I get enough of</span><br>
<span>Down there</span><br>
<span>Where a lot of people lie, In a deep sleep</span><br>
<span>And months on end go by, in a single week</span><br>

</div><h2><span>CHORUS</span>

                <span class="drums">DRUMS</span>

                <span class="chords">CHORDS</span>
                <span class="bass">BASS</span></h2>
<div><span>Down there</span><br>
<span>But much too slow</span><br>
<span>Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole</span><br>
<span>The air is running out we're sinking much too low</span><br>

</div><h2><span>VERSE 2</span>

                <span class="bass">BASS</span></h2>
<div><span>And if you sit long enough</span><br>
<span>You can hear ghost trains</span><br>
<span>As if the city speed</span><br>
<span>Is just in our brains</span><br>
<span>And coke's as close as we get to sugar cane</span><br>

</div><h2><span>CHORUS</span>
