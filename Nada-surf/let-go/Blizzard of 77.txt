[Verse 1]
In the blizzard of '77
The cars were just lumps on the snow
And then later, tripping in 7-Eleven
The shelves were stretching out of control
On a plane ride
The more it shakes
The more I have to let go
Now the signals
Still getting all mixed up
We're always doing damage control

[Chorus]
But in the middle of the night, I worry
It's blurry, even without light
In the middle of the night, I worry
It's blurry, even without light

[Verse 2]
I know I have got a negative edge
That's why I sharpen all the others a lot
It's like flowers or ladybugs
Pretty weeds or red beetles with dots

[Chorus]
But in the middle of the night, I worry
It's blurry, even without light
In the middle of the night, I worry
It's blurry, even without light

[Outro]
I miss you more than I knew
I miss you more than I knew
I miss you more than I knew
I miss you more than I knew
