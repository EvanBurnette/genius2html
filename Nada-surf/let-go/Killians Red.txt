[Verse 1]
I'm putting this night down to bed
'Cause I was sitting at the bar
Hoping you'd walk in the door
That says Killian's Red
'Cause I left you a note that said
"Come on out and we'll both get right off of our heads
And float up off the chair."

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll go on vacation, tonight
Under a sun of neon light
And I almost love this town
When I'm by your side, side

[Chorus]
You woke me from a long sleep
And I'm almost back
Closer than ever
To finding the hidden track
If I told you the truth
You wouldn't like what I said
I almost believed I was dead
There'll be no more waiting
You're gonna melt all the ice in my head
There'll be no more crying
You're gonna make it all better, instead

[Verse 1]
I'm putting this night down to bed
'Cause I was sitting at the bar
Hoping you'd walk in the door
That says Killian's Red
'Cause I left you a note that said
"Come on out and we'll both get right off of our heads
And float up off the chair."

[Bridge]
I get secrets at night
But they don't stay
I get secrets at night
But they go away

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll go on vacation, tonight
Under a sun of neon light
And I almost love this town
When I'm by your side, side

[Chorus]
You woke me from a long sleep
And I'm almost back
Closer than ever
To finding the hidden track
If I told you the truth
You wouldn't like what I said
I almost believed I was dead
There'll be no more waiting
You're gonna melt all the ice in my head
There'll be no more crying
You're gonna make it all better, instead
