<span>Lost the lie</span><br>
<span>I let myself believe</span><br>
<span>I'd be a brand new guy</span><br>
<span>But holy shit I'm just a door</span><br>

<span>Well...</span><br>
<span>I helped you to see out</span><br>
<span>Of your hole</span><br>
<span>Got the gas on in your house</span><br>
<span>Because you turned to coal</span><br>

<span>When you're back up on</span><br>
<span>Your feet</span><br>
<span>You'll move right past me</span><br>
<span>You're makin' plans with my friends</span><br>
<span>I know they're great</span><br>
<span>It's a little late to let me down</span><br>

<span>Oh no... I better go</span><br>
<span>You set the tone</span><br>
<span>You just don't know</span><br>
<span>You're scratching it in stone</span><br>

<span>I better wash my clothes</span><br>
<span>Take a bath</span><br>
<span>Move up and down the hall</span><br>
<span>Until I find my class</span><br>
<span>So I can be myself again</span><br>
<span>This movie has gotta end... (x3)</span><br>

<span>Do do..</span><br>
<span>Do do do do do do(x3)</span><br>

<span>This movie has gotta end... (x5)</span><br>

<span>Oh... yeah...(x4) (fades out)</span><br>
