<div><span>In the blizzard of '77</span><br>
<span>The cars were just lumps on the snow</span><br>
<span>And then later, tripping in 7-Eleven</span><br>
<span>The shelves were stretching out of control</span><br>
<span>On a plane ride</span><br>
<span>The more it shakes</span><br>
<span>The more I have to let go</span><br>
<span>Now the signals</span><br>
<span>Still getting all mixed up</span><br>
<span>We're always doing damage control</span><br>

</div><h2><span>CHORUS</span>

                <span class="drums">DRUMS</span>
                <span class="synth">SYNTH</span>
                <span class="chords">CHORDS</span>
                <span class="bass">BASS</span></h2>
<div><span>But in the middle of the night, I worry</span><br>
<span>It's blurry, even without light</span><br>
<span>In the middle of the night, I worry</span><br>
<span>It's blurry, even without light</span><br>

</div><h2><span>VERSE 2</span>

                <span class="bass">BASS</span></h2>
<div><span>I know I have got a negative edge</span><br>
<span>That's why I sharpen all the others a lot</span><br>
<span>It's like flowers or ladybugs</span><br>
<span>Pretty weeds or red beetles with dots</span><br>

</div><h2><span>CHORUS</span>

                <span class="drums">DRUMS</span>
                <span class="synth">SYNTH</span>
