[Verse 1]
Cats and dogs are coming down
14th street is gonna drown
Everyone else rushing around

[Chorus]
I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio

[Verse 2]
I've got no time I want to lose
To people with something to prove
What can you do but let them talk
And make your way down the block

[Chorus]
I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
I've got Blonde on Blonde
On my portable stereo
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio

[Refrain]
It's a lullaby
From a giant golden radio
It's a lullaby
From Wonder golden radio
It's a lullaby
From Wonder Woman's radio
It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby

[Outro]
It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby
It's a lullaby
