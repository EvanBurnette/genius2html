<div><span>Run</span><br>
<span>I run to fill the gaps I spot ahead</span><br>
<span>The traps I know I've set</span><br>
<span>For myself</span><br>
<span>To fall into and hide</span><br>
<span>I hide to spare myself from feeling shame</span><br>
<span>Learning from mistakes</span><br>
<span>When I know</span><br>
<span>It's me, who's to blame</span><br>

<div><span>I</span><br>
<span>I couldn't split the doubts of loneliness</span><br>
<span>From the pain of emptiness</span><br>
<span>But you helped</span><br>
<span>Figure out</span><br>
<span>Which was which</span><br>
<span>Which brings me to the part that's hard to say</span><br>
<span>The part that sounds so lame:</span><br>
<span>we are one</span><br>
<span>And the same</span><br>

<span>Would you grow</span><br>
<span>Beyond all</span><br>
<span>Of your dreams</span><br>
<span>That you got from a sleep at such a speed</span><br>
<span>Sowing thirsty seeds</span><br>
<span>While kissing</span><br>
<span>The palm</span><br>

<span>Show me all around</span><br>
<span>You're polishing the town</span><br>

<span>I saw you there</span><br>
<span>I knew right there and then</span><br>
<span>We'd never know the end</span><br>
<span>You took me with your hand</span><br>
<span>We're going to my den</span><br>
