[Verse 1]
So quiet
It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high
And the ring around the moon
Looks like light and love
Neither of which I get enough of
Down there
Where a lot of people lie, In a deep sleep
And months on end go by, in a single week

[Chorus]
Down there
But much too slow
Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole
The air is running out we're sinking much too low

[Verse 2]
And if you sit long enough
You can hear ghost trains
As if the city speed
Is just in our brains
And coke's as close as we get to sugar cane

[Chorus]
Down there
But much too slow
Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole
The air is running out we're sinking much too low

[Outro]
So quiet, So quiet
It's neither heaven nor space, It's just high
And the ring around the moon
Looks like light and love
Neither of which I get enough of
Neither of which I get enough of
