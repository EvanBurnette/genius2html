<div><span>Left some food wrapped up</span><br>
<span>In a plastic bag</span><br>
<span>On the kitchen table</span><br>
<span>Way too long</span><br>
<span>Sat down to eat</span><br>
<span>Next to the bag</span><br>
<span>I was too tired</span><br>
<span>To throw it out</span><br>
<span>I saw a swarm of fruit flies</span><br>
<span>I took the bag downstairs</span><br>
<span>When I came back</span><br>
<span>They were still there</span><br>
<span>Flying jerky patterns</span><br>
<span>Like snowflakes in the air</span><br>

<span>Right, straight</span><br>
<span>I can't find a reason</span><br>
<span>I know I'll keep going but</span><br>
<span>I can't find a reason</span><br>
<span>Nothing looks right</span><br>
<span>Nothing smells right</span><br>
<span>I can't land</span><br>
