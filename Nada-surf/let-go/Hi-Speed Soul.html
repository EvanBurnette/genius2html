<div><span>Do you ever feel like you just landed on this earth?</span><br>
<span>You see the creatures all do their dances, back and forth</span><br>
<span>You get restless and then you join them on the floor</span><br>
<span>Suddenly, it's tomorrow</span><br>
<span>It's not today anymore</span><br>
<span>It's not today anymore</span><br>

</div><h2><span>CHORUS</span>

<div><span>You talk to the ceiling every day</span><br>
<span>The speakers are shaking</span><br>
<span>Why do I hear you okay?</span><br>
<span>They're playing soul at the wrong speed</span><br>
<span>It sounds right, now</span><br>
<span>What are you doing to me?</span><br>

<div><span>Do you ever feel like what we call real life is not so real?</span><br>
<span>Tripping up on the same old problems you had last year</span><br>
<span>We'll pretend it's another planet not so uptight</span><br>
<span>The stars are shining above the city every night</span><br>
<span>They come every night</span><br>
