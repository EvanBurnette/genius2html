<div><span>I'm just a happy kid</span><br>
<span>Stuck with the heart of a sad punk</span><br>
<span>Drowning in my id</span><br>
<span>Always searching like it's on junk</span><br>
<span>No matter who I hang out with</span><br>
<span>I can hear the clack-clunk</span><br>
<span>Of the chains that pull the cars up</span><br>
<span>The roller coaster mountaintop so high</span><br>
<span>When it comes down, it shoots back up</span><br>
<span>Straight back to the sky</span><br>
<span>I gotta laugh and then I'm asleep</span><br>
<span>And then I walk around and wanna cry</span><br>

</div><h2><span>VERSE 2</span>

<div><span>Out at night to do the strand</span><br>
<span>The little candles make the bottles glow</span><br>
<span>Got ink all over my right hand</span><br>
<span>Getting crushes with no chance to grow</span><br>
<span>It's like I'll never ever land</span><br>
<span>There's always too much sun or too much snow</span><br>

</div><h2><span>CHORUS</span>

<div><span>I get slow days and no days</span><br>
<span>I get rusty and it's hard</span><br>
<span>But I get notions and oceans are coming to my call</span><br>
