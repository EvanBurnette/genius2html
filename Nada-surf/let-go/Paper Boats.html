<div><span>As the express train passes the local</span><br>
<span>It moves by just like a paper boat</span><br>
<span>Although it weighs a million pounds</span><br>
<span>I swear, it almost seems to float</span><br>
<span>And as we pass by each other</span><br>
<span>Our heads all full of bother</span><br>
<span>We can't look, we can't stop</span><br>
<span>We can't think, we can't stop</span><br>
<span>'Cause we're stuck in our own paths</span><br>
<span>And it's the way it always lasts</span><br>
<span>And I need something more from you</span><br>
