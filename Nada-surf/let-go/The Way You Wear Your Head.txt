[Verse 1]
Don't push me, 'cause I'll fall in love
With whatever you just said
Don't push me, 'cause I'll fall in love
With the way you wear your head

[Chorus]
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
You're glowing white

[Verse 2]
I want to want you
I need to need you
I'd love to love you
I want to want you
I need to need you
I'm begging to beg you

[Chorus]
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
You're glowing white

[Bridge]
I'd like to say good-bye to a complicated mind
But when I walk and wave
I'm stalked all day
By California lives
And things I didn't try
And ways you were unkind
And the strangest colored eyes

[Chorus]
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
Out in the corner
Out in the corner
Out in the corner
You're glowing white
